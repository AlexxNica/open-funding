An important question is obviously how projects can be funded to enable individuals to subsist and work on open source full time. This document aims to be an open guide to grant funding of open source projects.

Ghost is an open source blogging platform. The project is run and organized by The Ghost Foundation, which is a non-profit organization. Ghost is completely free to use if you host it yourself. You can pay for it if you need help with hosting your blog. This is what funds further development and The Ghost Foundation calls this *Sustainable Open Source*.
